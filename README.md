# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in C++. It is a two-player game where players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the board is filled up and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
